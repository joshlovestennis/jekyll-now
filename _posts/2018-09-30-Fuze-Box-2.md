  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered, by not giving up even when we were finding a section very difficult. I just kept trying systematically until we got the answer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned myself and my partner when completing the work, to make sure we were doing it correctly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked independently at times when my partner didn't know what to do so I had to find it out myself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected that we could of worked a bit faster so that we could have completed 2 courses instead of 1.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I engaged myself in the work even if my partner and I were finding it a bit boring.</td>

    <td>In my learning, I could have not made any spelling mistakes or grammar errors to speed up the process, even though I always corrected them. </td>

    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to be more considerate with what I am typing so that I don't make any mistakes which could cause an error in the programme. I could also be more alert when my partner is typing in the code so that he doesnâ€™t make any spelling or grammar mistakes either.</td>
