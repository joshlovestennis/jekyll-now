    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We had never used Fuze Box before so it was a completely new topic for us.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this Topic?</td>
    <td>My Target for this topic was to complete as many courses as I could with my partner and learn lots of new skills.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, I think I managed to complete a large amount of the Fuze Box courses and I learned a lot of different code from working through it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I persevered by making sure that my partner and I never gave up and persevered through the difficulties of each course.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I questioned myself by making sure that my code was accurate whenever I found an error.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I worked independently at times when my partner was unsure what to do. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected from this topic that although we got through quite a few courses, we could have gone a bit faster.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>I tried to engage myself in my work throughout the topic so that I wouldn't lose focus and go off topic.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have been a bit more efficient in my coding so that I wouldn't have to correct as much after checking. I could have also been more engaged when I wasn't the one coding to help stop my partner from making mistakes that we would have to correct.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to be just as engaged when my partner is coding to help speed up the process. I also need to keep being independent and not need to ask other students for help sometimes. However, I am quite happy with how the topic went as it helped developed my problem solving skills.</td>
